/**
 * Inhibit releasing the ball when the turntable speed varies too much

 * 
 * The hall sensor callback is used for determining how long the inhibition lasts
 * because the actual release time calculations are tied to the hall sensor.
 * The light sensor callback is used for determining when to inhibit because the
 * hall sensor only has state transitions two times per round, which is not enough
 * to reliably determine changes when the turntable speed is low.
 * After a change was detected, inhibition lasts for two (hall sensor) rounds. This 
 * is to ensure that the hall sensor measurement is stable enough for further calculations.
 * If during inhibition the speed changes again, the inhibition is again reset
 * to two rounds.
